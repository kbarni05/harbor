 * The music store publishes on every time-pos tick, so useMusicPlayer re-renders its owner
 * about ten times a second. A track list is the worst place for that: a 200 row playlist
 * would re-render every row on every tick, which is the pressure that starved LazyMount and
 * left rows blank. Only identity and phase matter to a row, and both change rarely, so the
 * store is collapsed to one short string and React bails out on every tick that did not
 * change it. Kept free of any player import so it stays testable on its own.
 *
 * The origin identity rides along because a row is played by resolving it to whichever source
 * can serve it, so the track that ends up playing rarely carries the id the row was drawn from.
